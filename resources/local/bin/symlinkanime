# intended to use with lf, it should work with the shell though.
# the idea is simple, go to the directory with files inside, then invoke the
# script without any arguments to automatically copy the folder recursively but
# with the files inside being symlinks. the default destination is ~/videos.
# you can also give it and argument indicating the folder you want to copy:
# symlink /path/of/folder/

of the relative one."
